<h1>CoastWatch Status Tool Help: Online data</h1>

<p>The online data panel shows details for the current satellite
datasets on the server:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cwstatus_online.png"></p>

<p>The following information is displayed:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Satellite</dt>

  <dd>The satellite name.  Satellite names are short
  abbreviations given by the agency responsible for launching the
  satellite.</dd>

  <dt>Sensor</dt>

  <dd>The satellite sensor.  Most satellites have multiple
  sensors on board, each with a different observational
  purpose.</dd>

  <dt>Date and Time</dt>

  <dd>The date and time of the satellite data referenced from
  Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  The date format is given as
  YYYY/MM/DD and time as 24-hour HH:MM.</dd>

  <dt>Scene</dt>

  <dd>The scene time.  This indicates that the data coverage is
  either fully daytime, fully nighttime, or mixed day and night
  if the data spans the solar terminator.</dd>

  <dt>Orbit</dt>

  <dd>The orbit type.  This indicates that the satellite was
  travelling northward (ascending) or southward (descending)
  while the data was observed.</dd>

  <dt>Lines</dt>

  <dd>The number of data lines (rows) which indicates the pass
  duration for polar orbiting satellites.</dd>

  <dt>Station</dt>

  <dd>The ground capture station responsible for receiving the
  satellite data.</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can select a dataset of interest by clicking a line in the
table.  Once selected, the data coverage and preview displays
change to show the characteristics of the new dataset.  The table
contents may be re-sorted based on a specific column by clicking
on the column header.  The table is originally sorted by
date.</p>
