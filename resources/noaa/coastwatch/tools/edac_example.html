<h1>EDAC Help: A step-by-step example</h1>

<p>Suppose that your goal as a data user is to find the most recent
chlorophyll-a data for southern Florida.  The most obvious way to find
the data would be to select the chlorophyll-a dataset, select the
latest date and time, and zoom in on southern Florida.  But in many
cases due to cloud cover, data may not be available in the latest file
and the data view will show nothing.  Use the following steps as a
guide to find and view the data:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Switch to the Catalog tab, revealing the search parameters and
  results panels.</li>

  <li>Make sure that the chlorophyll-a dataset is selected at the top
  of the data access client.</li>

  <li>Select your region of interest at the top of the search
  parameters, for example <span class="emph">Southern
  Florida</span>.</li>

  <li>Change the percent coverage value to about 20.</li>

  <li>Change the number of days to about 10.</li>

  <li>Click the <span class="emph">Search</span> button and the
  results panel should show a number of thumbnail previews.  If not,
  relax the search parameters by decreasing the coverage value or
  increasing the number of days and click <span
  class="emph">Search</span> again.</li>

  <li>The data may now be selected by one of two methods:
  <ol type="a">

    <li><span class="strong">Directly from the Icon View:</span>
    Select a thumbnail preview that has enough data for your area of
    interest.  Double-click the thumbnail to show the data in the
    View tab.</li>

    <li><span class="strong">From the List View:</span> Switch the
    results panel to the <span class="emph">List View</span> tab and
    click the header of the <span class="emph">Coverage</span> column
    to sort the table in ascending order by coverage of the selected
    region.  Double-click the last table entry (ie: with the highest
    coverage value) to show the data in the View tab.</li>

  </ol></li>

  <li>In the View tab, zoom in on your region of interest, either by
  using the <span class="emph">Zoom to Selected</span> button and
  manually clicking and dragging a rectangle, or using the <span
  class="emph">Show Region</span> button and selecting the geographic
  location name, for example <span class="emph">Southern
  Florida</span>.</li>

  <li>Your data of interest is now displayed.  Pass the mouse pointer
  over the data view to show the chlorophyll-a data value and
  geographic coordinates.  Use the toolbar to change the overlays,
  view area, palette, and color scale range.  CoastWatch HDF data can
  be downloaded to work with locally using the CoastWatch Data
  Analysis Tool (CDAT), or accessed via OPeNDAP (see <a
  href="edac_access.html">Accessing data files</a> for more details on
  CDAT and OPeNDAP).</li>

</ol>
