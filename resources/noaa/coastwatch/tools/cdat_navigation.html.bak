<h2>What is a navigational correction?</h2>

<p>Small errors can exist in the latitude and longitude of each
pixel when a satellite's true orientation and position are not
known exactly.  In this case the data view image may not line up
correctly with coastline overlays.  The image may appear to be
shifted, rotated, or sheared in comparison to the coastlines.
You can use the navigational correction tool to write a
correction value to the data file so that the data view image
lines up correctly with actual geographic features.  Navigational
correction is not likely to be necessary if the data file has
been produced recently, but may be needed for older data from
CoastWatch IMGMAP (.cwf) files for example, or from experimental
data products and satellites.</p>

<h2>Visual and manual correction</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the navigational correction controls,
with visual correction mode, manual correction fields, and data
variable list:</p>

<p>You can use the visual correction modes to apply corrections
by clicking and dragging on the data view.  The <span
class="gui">Translation</span> mode corrects the image by
shifting the origin by some number of rows and columns.  The
<span class="gui">Rotation</span> mode corrects the image by
rotating it about the view center.  Analogous manual corrections
may be applied using the manual controls by setting the field
values and clicking <span class="gui">Perform</span>.  The
cumulative set of corrections may be reset by clicking <span
class="gui">Reset correction to identity</span> option.  The
manual correction options also include a general affine option,
which is applied using matrix multiplication:</p>

<pre>
  |r'|    |a c e| |r|
  |c'| =  |b d f| |c|
  |1 |    |0 0 1| |1|
</pre>

<h2>Correction variables</h2>

<p>Navigational corrections should only be applied to sensor and
sensor-derived data variables in a data file -- not earth
location, graphics, or viewing angle data.  You must select which
specific variables to correct.  When corrections are performed
either visually or manually, they are applied only to the
selected variables in the list.  Examples of data variables that
may require correction include AVHRR channel data, SST and cloud.
The following figure shows an example of an uncorrected and
corrected SST image:</p>
