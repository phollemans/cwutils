<h2>Introducing the Catalog tab</h2>

<p>The Catalog tab allows the user to quickly search for files in the
selected dataset that match certain criteria: (i) the percent of data
coverage for a region of interest, and (ii) the date and time of the
data measurement.  The catalog results show either a set of icon
previews for each matching result or a sortable list view of the
results.  For any given result, the user can show the data in the View
tab, or access the data by file download or OPeNDAP form.

<h2>Components of the Catalog tab</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the main components of the client
when the Catalog tab is selected:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="edac_catalog.png"></p>

<dl>
  
  <dt>Dataset selector</dt>

  <dd>The name of the current dataset being displayed.  A dataset
  consists of a number of files, each of which contains data for a
  specific date and time.  The catalog searches only the selected
  dataset for matching files.</dd>

  <dt>Region parameters</dt>

  <dd>The region and minimum coverage value to search.  A region may
  not contain data for a given date and time because of a variety of
  factors: cloud cover over the region obscuring the surface, ice,
  rain, the region is beyond the satellite scan path, etc.  Only data
  with coverage above the specified minimum value in the selected
  region will be reported.</dd>

  <dt>Date/time parameters</dt>

  <dd>The date and time range to search.  Only data files whose
  starting date/time fall within the specified time range or past
  number of days are reported.</dd>

  <dt>Catalog results</dt>

  <dd>The results of the most recent search.  The message at the
  bottom of the results panel may indicate zero matches if none were
  found in which case the search parameters should be relaxed.
  Otherwise, the results panel shows either a set of preview icons for
  the resulting matches or a detailed sortable list of the matches.
  Double-click the preview icon or list entry to switch to the View
  tab and display the data.  As an alternative, users may download the
  file directly or show the OPeNDAP form using the data access buttons
  at the bottom (see <a href="edac_access.html">Accessing data
  files</a> for details).</dd>
