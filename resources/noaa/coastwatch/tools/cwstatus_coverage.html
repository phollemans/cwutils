<h1>CoastWatch Status Tool Help: Coverage display</h1>

<p>The data coverage display shows a detailed view of the
selected satellite dataset on the Earth surface:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cwstatus_coverage.png"></p>

<p>The coverage footprint is drawn and highlighted on top of
coastlines, latitude/longitude grid lines, and the solar
terminator.  Two hemispheres are shown, the darker areas
representing darkness at the time of the dataset, and lighter
areas representing daylight.  The earth sphere may be rotated by
clicking and dragging with the mouse.</p>
