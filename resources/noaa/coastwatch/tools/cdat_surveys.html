<h2>What are surveys?</h2>

<p>Surveys allow you to compute statistics on areas of the data
view.  Performing a data survey results in a printout of
statistics, a plot of the survey data, and an outline of the
survey area on the data view.  Surveys may be performed at a
point, along a line, or within a box or polygon.</p>

<h2>Survey modes</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the survey controls, with the survey mode
buttons, current list of surveys, and the survey results and plot
tabs:</p>

<p>Depending on which survey type is selected by the <span
class="gui">Survey Mode</span> button, one of the following actions is
performed:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Point (single slick)</dt>

  <dd>A single point is surveyed, with no statistics or plot.  A point
  survey is a good way to mark a certain position and easily be able
  to recall its data value, such as for an ocean buoy.</dd>

  <dt>Line (click and drag)</dt>

  <dd>A straight line is surveyed, with statistics and a plot of the
  data values along the line.  A line survey simulates an airplane or
  ship track of the data values, and is useful for gradient and front
  analysis.</dd>

  <dt>Box (click and drag)</dt>

  <dd>A rectangular box is surveyed, with statistics and a plot of the
  histogram bins within the box.  A box survey is useful for a
  clustering analysis to show groups of similar data values in an area
  as peaks in the histogram.</dd>

  <dt>Polygon (click corners, double- or right-click to end)</dt>

  <dd>A polygon is surveyed, with statistics and a plot of the
  histogram bins within the polygon.  Polygon surveys are similar to
  box surveys, but can help when the area has an irregular shape.</dd>

</dl>

<a name="list"></a>
<h2>Survey list</h2>

<p>Once added to the survey list, surveys are similar to
overlays, in that they can be modified, renamed, set visible or
invisible, moved up or down in the list, and deleted (see the <a
href="cdat_overlays.html#list">overlays</a> section for details).
Select a survey in the list to recall its specific data in the
<span class="gui">Results</span> and <span
class="gui">Plot</span> tabs.</p>
