<h2>What are overlays?</h2>

<p>CDAT uses data overlays to help give context to the data view.  An
overlay can show where latitude and longitude lines fall, where
physical boundaries such as coastline, political borders, and
bathymetric contours lie, and can also mask off certain parts of the
view so that only the relevant data is visible.</p>

<a name="adding"></a>
<h2>Adding an overlay to the view</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the overlay controls, with the overlay
addition buttons, current list of overlays, and the saved overlay
groups:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cdat_overlays.png" width="260"></p>

<p>You can add one of several types of overlays to the data view
using the <span class="gui">Add Overlay</span> buttons:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Grid</dt>

  <dd>Latitude and longitude grid lines with labels.  By default, the
  grid spacing adapts to the view, but may be set manually.</dd>

  <dt>Coast</dt>

  <dd>Land/water boundaries derived from Global
  Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines (GSHHS)
  data: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/gshhs.html.</dd>

  <dt>Political</dt>

  <dd>International and state border lines derived from CIA
  WDB-II data.  By default, only international borders are shown
  and state borders must be added manually.</dd>

  <dt>Topography</dt>

  <dd>Topographic and bathymetric contours derived from ETOPO5
  elevation data: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo5.HTML.  By
  default, only the 200&nbsp;m and 2000&nbsp;m bathymetric contours
  are shown, but the overlay may be modified to include any set of
  topographic or bathymetric contours.</dd>

  <dt>Mask -> Bitmask</dt>

  <dd>A single-color mask that uses a data variable and integer
  mask value to mask certain data pixels that contain the same
  bits as the mask value.  For example, a bitmask can be used to
  mask clouds as gray.</dd>

  <dt>Mask -> Multilayer</dt>

  <dd>A multiple-color mask that uses a data variable and color
  for each bit to mask certain data pixels that contain the bit
  values with the corresponding color.  For example, a multilayer
  mask can be used to analyze the detailed output of a cloud
  masking algorithm.</dd>

  <dt>Mask -> Expression Mask</dt>

  <dd>A single-color mask that uses a mathematical expression and
  color for each bit to mask certain data pixels for which the
  result of the expression is true.  An expression mask is slower
  to compute than a bitmask or multilayer, but is much more
  flexible.  See the User's Guide cwmath command for the syntax
  of the expressions.  Only variables imported when the data was
  opened may be used in the expression.</dd>

  <dt>Shape</dt>

  <dd>Line and polygon data stored in ESRI shapefile format.
  Currently, shapefile support is limited: point data cannot be
  displayed, shape overlays cannot be saved to an overlay group, and
  shapefile rendering may be slow for large shapefiles.</dd>

</dl>

<a name="list"></a>
<h2>Overlay list</h2>

<p>Once added to the list, overlays may be modified, renamed, set
visible or invisible, moved up or down in the list, and deleted.
To edit an overlay's properties, double-click the overlay in the
list or select the overlay and click the <span class="gui">Edit
Properties</span> button.  You can change simple line properties
such as color and thickness directly from the list.  To rename an
overlay, edit the overlay's name text field.  Overlay visibility
can be changed by checking or unchecking the visibility box on
the left.  The overlay list represents a vertical stack and
overlays are rendered in order from bottom to top.  You can use
the <span class="gui">Move Up</span> and <span class="gui">Move
Down</span> buttons to rearrange the overlay stacking order.
Finally, you can delete overlays by selecting a set of overlays
from the list using Ctrl-click (&#8984;-click on the Mac) or
Shift-click, and clicking <span class="gui">Delete</span>.</p>

<a name="groups"></a>
<h2>Overlay groups</h2>

<p>Overlay groups are a convenient means of saving a set of
overlays to be used later.  Save a set of overlays as a group by
selecting the overlays using Ctrl-click (&#8984;-click on the
Mac) or Shift-click, clicking the <span class="gui">Save
Group</span> button, and giving the new group a name.  Restore a
saved group by selecting an overlay group and clicking <span
class="gui">Open Group</span>.  The overlays are restored with
the same properties they had when saved, and stacked on top of
any other overlays already in the list.  An overlay group may be
deleted by clicking <span class="gui">Delete Group</span>.  CDAT
comes with a default set of overlay groups that you may find
useful; see the <a
href="cdat_preferences.html#resources">preferences and
resources</a> section for more details.</p>
