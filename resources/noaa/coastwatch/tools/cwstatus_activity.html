<h1>CoastWatch Status Tool Help: Server activity</h1>

<p>The server status panel below allows you to monitor server
activity:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cwstatus_status.png"></p>

<p>The following information is displayed:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Host</dt>

  <dd>Shows the server host name and last known status update
  time.  The server is queried once every minute to determine the
  current status, activity, files, and online data.</dd>

  <dt>Activity</dt>

  <dd>Indicates the server activity using several icons and an
  activity message: <p class="quote"><img
  src="cwstatus_icons.png"></p> The icons are colorized when the
  corresponding activity is being performed.  The icons denote
  (left to right) server idle, receiving data files, processing
  data, and error.  The error icon indicates that the server
  cannot be contacted for a status update.</dd>

  <dt>Incoming</dt>

  <dd>Shows a list of data files currently being received.  Data
  files are retrieved by the server from a number of foreign
  hosts and take time to be completely transferred.</dd>

  <dt>Waiting</dt>

  <dd>Shows a list of data files currently waiting to be
  processed.  These data files have been recently transferred
  from a foreign host but have not been through the data
  processing cycle.</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can change the server being monitored using the <span
class="gui">File|New server</span> menu item.  Once you enter the
new server name or IP address and click <span
class="gui">OK</span>, there may be a small delay while the
program retrieves the status and online data from the new
server.</p>
