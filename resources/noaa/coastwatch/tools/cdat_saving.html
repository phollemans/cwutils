<h2>About exporting</h2>

<p>Data may be exported to a variety of formats.  Image formats
such as JPEG and PNG contain color pixel data computed by
converting data values to colors using the active enhancement and
palette.  The output file contains an image similar to the
current data view.  Data formats such as HDF and binary raster
contain one or more grids of 8-bit to 64-bit data values computed
directly from the source data.  Select <span
class="gui">File|Export</span> from the menu or click <span
class="gui">Export</span> on the toolbar to export data.</p>

<h2>Image formats</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>PNG image</dt>

  <dd>A non-lossy compressed image format supported by most web
  browsers and image manipulation software. PNG has similar data
  compression characteristics to GIF and additionally supports 24-bit
  color images.</dd>

  <dt>GIF image</dt>

  <dd>A non-lossy compressed format also supported by most web
  browsers and image manipulation software.  The GIF files produced
  use LZW compression.  Images stored in GIF format are run through a
  color quantization algorithm to reduce the color map to 256 colors
  or less.  Although file sizes are generally smaller than PNG, image
  quality may be compromised by the reduced color map.</dd>

  <dt>JPEG image</dt>

  <dd>A lossy compressed format that should be used with caution for
  images with sharp color lines such as those found in text and
  annotation graphics.  The JPEG format generally achieves higher
  compression than PNG or GIF resulting in smaller image file
  sizes.</dd>

  <dt>GeoTIFF image</dt>

  <dd>A flexible image format with support for earth location
  metadata.  Many popular GIS packages handle GeoTIFF images and allow
  the user to combine a GeoTIFF base map image with other sources of
  raster and vector data.  The GeoTIFF images generated are non-lossy
  uncompressed image data (unless a compression is specified in the
  options), and can be much larger than the corresponding PNG, GIF, or
  JPEG.  In general the GeoTIFFs generated are 24-bit colour images,
  but when no overlays are used or the image color option is set, a
  special 8-bit paletted image file is generated and comments
  describing the data value scaling are inserting into the image
  description tags.</dd>

  <dt>PDF document</dt>

  <dd>A standard document format for high quality publishing developed
  by Adobe Systems and used for output to a printer via such tools as
  the Adobe Acrobat Reader.  In general, PDF files are slightly larger
  than the equivalent PNG but retain highly accurate vector graphics
  components such as lines and fonts. </dd>

<h2>Data formats</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>CoastWatch HDF</dt>

  <dd>Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) version 4 with CoastWatch
  metadata.  HDF is a scientific data format used by CoastWatch and
  others to distribute satellite data.  Information and access
  software may be found at http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu.  A description of
  current CoastWatch metadata standards is available in the
  CoastWatch Utilities user's guide.</dd>

  <dt>Binary raster</dt>

  <dd>A simple stream of binary data values -- either 8-bit unsigned
  bytes, 16-bit signed integers, or 32-bit IEEE floating point values.
  Data values may optionally be scaled to integers using the equation
  <span class="code">integer = value/factor + offset</span>.  Each
  data variable may be prepended with a 72-bit dimension header: 8-bit
  dimension count (always 2) with 32-bit row count, 32-bit column
  count.</dd>

  <dt>Text file</dt>

  <dd>An ASCII text file with latitude, longitude, and data value
  printed -- one data value per line.  Each data variable may be
  prepended with a 1-line dimension header: dimension count (always
  2), row count, column count.</dd>

  <dt>ArcGIS binary grid</dt>

  <dd>A stream of 32-bit IEEE floating point values, ready for input
  to ESRI's ArcGIS as a binary grid file.  A header file may also be
  created to specify the earth location and other parameters.</dd>
