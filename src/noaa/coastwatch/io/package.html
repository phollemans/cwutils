Provides classes for reading and writing satellite data in a variety
of formats.<p>

The basis of all satellite data input functionality in the CWF
software library is the {@link noaa.coastwatch.io.EarthDataReader}
class and subclasses.  The reader classes provide generic methods for
reading metadata and data variables one at a time from CoastWatch
IMGMAP files ({@link noaa.coastwatch.io.CWFReader}) and CoastWatch HDF
files ({@link noaa.coastwatch.io.CWHDFReader}).  Also supported are
TeraScan HDF files ({@link noaa.coastwatch.io.TSHDFReader}) which have
a similar format to CoastWatch HDF but with different Earth location
metadata.  To open a new file of unknown format, the {@link
noaa.coastwatch.io.EarthDataReaderFactory} attempts to guess the
file format and provide a <code>EarthDataReader</code> object.<p>

The writer classes, subclasses of {@link
noaa.coastwatch.io.EarthDataWriter}, support the creation of many
different output file formats.  In particular, the {@link
noaa.coastwatch.io.BinaryWriter} classes write data variables as a
stream of binary data values, the {@link
noaa.coastwatch.io.TextWriter} class handles the writing of ASCII text
files, and the {@link noaa.coastwatch.io.CWHDFWriter} writes
CoastWatch HDF format.<p>
