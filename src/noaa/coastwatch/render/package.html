Provides a number of classes used for rendering data to images.<p>

The top-level rendering class {@link
noaa.coastwatch.render.EarthDataView} uses the data values from one or
more {@link noaa.coastwatch.util.DataVariable} objects to create an
image.  A number of {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.EarthDataOverlay}
objects may be used to render graphical overlays such as coast or grid
lines on the main view image.  Legends may be rendered on or beside
the view image using {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.Legend} objects.
The {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.EarthDataPlot} class groups an
<code>EarthDataView</code> and various legends to produce a standard
presentation quality data plot.<p>

The subclass {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.ColorEnhancement} is an
<code>EarthDataView</code> which assigns colors to data values based
on {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.Palette} and {@link
noaa.coastwatch.render.EnhancementFunction} objects.  The
<code>Palette</code> class represents an indexed set of colors read
from a special format data file.  The <code>EnhancementFunction</code>
class determines the mapping of data values to colors.<p>

The subclass {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.ColorComposite} is an
<code>EarthDataView</code> that creates an image using three data
values for the red, green, and blue components of each pixel.  A color
composite may be used to emphasize certain spectral features in a
satellite image that can only be seen using multiple data channels.<p>

The {@link noaa.coastwatch.render.LineFeatureSource} and {@link
noaa.coastwatch.render.feature.LineFeature} classes combine to allow the
reading and rendering of Earth polyline data such as coast lines and
political boundaries.  <code>LineFeature</code> objects are normally
used in conjunction with <code>EarthDataOverlay</code> objects to
provide line annotation for data views.<p>
