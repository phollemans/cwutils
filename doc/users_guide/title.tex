\section*{Providing Feedback}

Email questions, comments, suggestions, and bug reports to the
CoastWatch help desk at \\
\href{mailto:coastwatch.info@noaa.gov}{coastwatch.info@noaa.gov}.
In order to receive help, you \underline{should} include the
following information:
\begin{enumerate}

  \item The version and operating system of the software, for
  example {\em cwutils-3.3.2 on Windows 10}.

  \item The type of data file and where you obtained the file,
  for example {\em CoastWatch .cwf files obtained from the SAA web
  site}.  If the data origin is unknown, include some example data
  filenames.

  \item If sending a bug report or asking for clarification, a
  description of how to reproduce your result:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item For a command-line tool, a transcript of the terminal
    session during which the question or problem arose.  You
    can cut and paste the contents
    of the terminal session including the command used and its output
    directly into the email.

    \item For a graphical interface tool, a list of steps to
    reproduce the problem.  For example, {\em
    Open data file xxx, click this button, then that button}.

\section*{Typographic Conventions}

In this manual, we use the following conventions for the font and
color of text.  References within the document are in the
standard font, but are red to emphasize that they are active
links, for example a reference to a section: ``see
\autoref{cdatchap} for information on the CoastWatch Data
Analaysis Tool''.  External references are a {\tt typewriter}
font in magenta, such as a web site address:
``\url{http://www.google.com} is a great search engine''.
Terminal commands, terminal output, file names, and verbatim
character strings are in a {\file typewriter} font.  Java class
names are in {\java italics}.  Replacement parameters in command
line programs are in CAPITALS.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

We would like to acknowledge the following parties for support in
creating the CoastWatch Utilities software (in no particular
order):
\begin{itemize}

  \item John Sapper of NOAA/NESDIS, CoastWatch central
  operations, and many other NOAA/NESDIS researchers for
  continued funding support and new requirements.

  \item The CoastWatch node managers, operations managers, and
  CLASS archive staff who were invaluable in providing feedback.

  \item CoastWatch data users who have provided critical review
  of the software, bug reports, and new ideas for functionality.

  \item The open source software community for providing high
  quality code libraries upon which the utilities are built.

\end{itemize}
