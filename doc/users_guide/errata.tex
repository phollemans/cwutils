Parts of this guide have not kept pace with the software development.
Specific inaccuracies herein include the following and will be remedied in
a future version of this guide:
\begin{itemize}

  \item The chapter on CDAT is outdated and contains diagrams for versions
  3.8.0 and earlier.  The new layout of CDAT version 4.0.0 is different, 
  though some panels are similar and have similar functionality.

%% CDAT chapter itself also contains a notice
