\chapter*{Errata}

Parts of this manual have not kept pace with the software development.
Specific inaccuracies herein include the following and will be remedied in
a future version of this manual:
\begin{itemize}

\item The current version of the software no longer supports .cwf data files,
described as CoastWatch IMGMAP format.  Various references to this data
format are out of date and should be ignored.

\item The ability to read network data files via the OPeNDAP protocol is
disabled and does not appear in the CDAT file open window, and
the preferences directory settings relating to OPeNDAP servers are not used.

\item There are some locations in this guide that have not been updated to
mention support for NetCDF 4 data as an import or export format, for example
in CDAT.

\end{itemize}
