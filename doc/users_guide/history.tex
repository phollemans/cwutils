%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NEW VERSION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section*{Version 3.1.8, 2004/11/25}

\subsection*{Updates}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Extended data caching in I/O routines to handle arbitrary size
  data arrays. Previously, some utilities would memory-thrash when
  faced with a large column count.

  \item Renamed various SatelliteXXX classes to EarthXXX to mirror
  more generality in metadata.

  \item Updated I/O for new metadata specifications, including
  multiple time periods and composite attributes.

  \item Updated coastline data files to GSHHS v1.3 and corrected known
  polygon fill problems on the US East Coast, Africa, and South
  America.

  \item Updated ETOPO5 topography database and corrected problems with
  contours fills producing strange bullseye artifacts.

  \item Added a -{-}timeout option to cwdownload to allow the user to
  select a network timeout value.

  \item Added a -{-}transform option to cwinfo to print Earth transform
  information.

  \item Modified the behaviour of cwcomposite to append dataset
  metadata together rather than simply use the last file's global
  metadata (time, satellite, etc). The -{-}pedantic option was also
  added to allow exact tracking of source dataset metadata.

  \item Added a -{-}inputs option to cwcomposite to allow the user to
  specify a list of files in a text file rather than on the command
  line.

  \item Recompiled the HDF library for Linux to allow up to 256 open
  files. This allows the cwcomposite to handle more than 31 input
  datasets which was the previous limit.

  \item Modified cwmath to allow multiple input files, and output to
  an existing file that is not an input file.

  \item Updated to new install4j installation package wizard to fix
  various bugs and allow the user to select components during a
  graphical installation.

  and the user switches tabs, the data view does not continue to
  render to the wrong tab.

  \item Fixed CDAT problem with allowing multiple overlay property
  control dialogs.

  \item Fixed CDAT problem with contour level deletion causing a
  stall.

  \item Added help buttons in some areas of CDAT to aid users in
  getting context-specific help.

  \item Added color scale legend beside data view in CDAT in
  response to user suggestions.

  \item Added warning message in CDAT before applying navigation
  to make sure user understands that the data file is being
  modified.

  \item Changed ``Save As'' in CDAT to ``Export'' to avoid
  confusion.  The data file should be thought of as read-only and
  the save formats as export formats.

  \item Changed the order of operations for exporting data in
  CDAT to simplify the number of steps users need to perform.

  \item Added continuous enhancement updates in CDAT for visual
  appeal.

  \item Updated icons for data view controls in CDAT.

  \item Added drag-and-drop support in CDAT for opening data
  files.

  abnormally slow.

  \item Added support in NOAA 1b reading code for version 4 and 5
  file formats, 8-bit and 16-bit sensor word sizes, MetOp data
  files, and files with missing scan lines.

  \item Added support for user file formats via the extensions/
  directory.

  \item Added TIFF file compression in CDAT and cwrender.

  \item Added code for the Earth Data Access Client (EDAC) for
  for use by the CoastWatch East Coast Node (ECN).

  \item Added support in TeraScan HDF I/O code for importing a
  user-specified set of attributes.

  \item Updated GSHHS reading code to handle binned political
  line data, and replaced databases in TeraScan vector format
  with new HDF binned data from GMT.  This speeds up the access
  and rendering of state and international lines considerably.

  \item Enhanced color scale in cwrender and CDAT to correctly
  show log scale ticks above the highest power of ten on the
  scale.  This helps with chlorophyll plotting when users scale
  between non-power-of-ten minimum and maximum.

  \item Added CDAT and cwrender palettes for Coral Reef Watch
  data.

  \item Added the {-}-coherent option to cwcomposite based on
  CoastWatch central processing request.  See the manual page for
  details.

  \item Updated look and content of application help files for
  CDAT, cwmaster, and cwstatus to be easier to read and navigate.

  cwmath.

  \item Added the {-}-overwrite option to cwregister based on
  CoastWatch central processing request.  See the manual page for
  details.

  \item Added the ability in cwrender to accept multiple
  {-}-shape and {-}-bitmask options.  This makes rendering much
  more flexible.

  \item Added the {-}-variable option to cwsample.  It was
  confusing to users to have only {-}-match and not be able to
  depend on the ordering of columns in the output text file.

  \item Added the {-}-region option to cwstats that takes a
  center point and radius for sampling.

  \item Modified the base directory for user preferences to be
  operating system specific.  The base directory was causing
  problems because different operating systems expect software to
  place customization directories in different locations.  See
  the help files in CDAT for the new locations.

  \item Standardized on coastwatch.info@noaa.gov as the
  destination for all support emails.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bug fixes}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Fixed error with log enhancement normalization by
  disabling the Normalize button for log enhancements.

  cwexport.  Header file accuracy was being impacted by writing
  to only two decimal places.

  \item Fixed problem when reading OPeNDAP files with 2D data of
  odd dimensions.

  \item Fixed error with retrieving chunks lengths while reading
  netCDF files, since netCDF has no chunking or compression
  support.
  
  \item Fixed null line color errors in CDAT overlays.

  \item Fixed problem with rendering text shadows for black grid
  lines in CDAT and cwrender.

  \item Fixed problem with lat/lon separator characters in
  cwautonav.  Now the documentation and implementation match.

  \item Fixed cwdownload to delete partial files when a transfer
  error occurs.

  \item Fixed the lack of equation description in log-enhanced
  GeoTIFF output from cwrender and CDAT.

  \item Fixed error when working with geographic projection data
  that crosses the date line.

  64-bit HDF 4 and 5 libraries.
  
  \item Added read support in all tools for data files in NetCDF 4 with L2P
  metadata.

  \item Added support for memory caching when reading NetCDF 4 data files.

\end{itemize}

\hspace{0.4cm} {\bf Command line tools}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Added a print option to cwinfo for Common Data Model coordinate 
  system information (if available).
  
  \item Added extra options to cwrender for: (i) rendering with custom color
  palettes specified by a file or directly on the command line, (ii) adding
  watermark text to the image, and (iii) manually specifying the data scale
  tick marks.

  \item Converted all GCTP coordinate transform code to Java to run on 64-bit
  Java VMs for all tools.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\bigicon{bug_yellow} Bug fixes}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Fixed the error message ``no parent window'' when opening data files.

  \item Fixed problem with reliably closing HDF 4 files.
  
  \item Corrected direction error in vector symbols (winds, currents, etc).

  \item Fixed non-functional State Plane Coordinate System support.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Version 3.3.1, 2016/01/20}

\subsection*{\bigicon{box_software} Updates}

\hspace{0.4cm} {\bf Graphical tools}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Added ability in CDAT to save/recall window size since the last time
  the application was run.  Also added menu options to set window to various
  predefined sizes or a custom size.

  \item Added preference options in CDAT to allow the user to specify the
  maximum Java Virtual Machine heap size for dynamic memory allocation, and
  a cache size for data tiles read from HDF and NetCDF files.  This allows CDAT
  to better read files with large compressed data chunks, and users who need to
  have many files open at once to better manage their memory requirements.

  \item Bitmask overlays in CDAT now handle up to 32-bit integer mask values.
  This is much better for cloud mask testing than the original maximum value
  of 255.

  \item Updated latitude/longitude line labelling algorithm to handle full-disk
  projections such as orthographic and near-size perspective.  The new
  algorithm places line labels in the center of the image rather than at the
  edges.

  \item Added an experimental scripting console to CDAT that allows users to
  run their own custom code within CDAT using Java language syntax.  All the
  APIs documented in the CoastWatch Utilities are available.

\end{itemize}

\hspace{0.4cm} {\bf File formats and I/O}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Added NetCDF 4 file saving from cwexport and CDAT.  NetCDF 4 files are
  written with CF-1.4 metadata, and compressed in chunks.  This is an
  alternative to NetCDF 3 files which do not support compression.

  \item Improvements for reading ACSPO NetCDF and HDF format files, both
  polar orbiting and geostationary data.

  \item Added end of data capture to time period read from NOAA 1b format
  files.  Previously only start of data capture was read.

  \item Added support for reading data that is written from south to north
  and west to east.  Some data providers prefer this order, and data appeared
  upside-down in CDAT and other tools.

\end{itemize}

\hspace{0.4cm} {\bf Command line tools}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Added Unix man pages for all tools.

  \item Added identification of file reading module used to recognize a file
  format to the output of cwinfo.  Also improved output spacing when
  encountering long variable names.

  \item Improved the output of registration in cwregister when time-sequential
  swaths are being registered to the same master and then combined with
  cwcomposite.  Previously, single-pixel gaps existed between time-sequential
  swaths.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\bigicon{bug_yellow} Bug fixes}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Fixed issues with memory leaking when closing some file formats.  This
  was resulting in an ``out of heap space'' error message.

  \item Many internal documentation and unit testing updates.

  \item Fixed Java VM splash screen in graphical tools to reliably indicate
  loading delays.

  \item Fixed issue with Java VM crashing due to multiple threads accessing
  native HDF 4 and 5 libraries.

  \item Fixed error when performing a point survey.

  \item Fixed startup issue on some Windows machines when attempting to
  read user preferences file.

  \item Fixed numerical issues in registration when the source file contains
  data on either side of the -180/+180 longitude boundary.

\end{itemize}
