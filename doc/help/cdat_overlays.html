<h2>What are overlays?</h2>

<p>CDAT uses data overlays to help give context to the data view.  An
overlay can show where latitude and longitude lines fall, where
physical boundaries such as coastline, political borders, and
bathymetric contours lie, and can also mask off certain parts of the
view so that only the relevant data is visible.</p>

<a name="adding"></a>
<h2>Adding an overlay to the view</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the current overlays and the saved overlay
groups:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cdat_overlays.png" width="260" class="shadow"></p>

<p>You can add one of several types of overlays to the data view
using the CDAT toolbar buttons as follows:</p>

<dl>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="earth2.png" class="icon"> Coastlines</span></dt>
  <dd>Land/water boundaries derived from Global
  Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines (GSHHS)
  data: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/gshhs.html.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="environment.png" class="icon"> Latitude / longitude grid</span></dt>
  <dd>Latitude and longitude grid lines with labels.  By default, the
  grid spacing adapts to the view, but can be set manually.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="cube_molecule.png" class="icon"> Row / column grid</span></dt>
  <dd>Data row and column grid lines with labels.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="flag_red.png" class="icon"> Country and state borders</span></dt>
  <dd>Lines are derived from CIA WDB-II data.  By default, only international 
  borders are shown &#8212; state borders can be added manually by editing 
  the overlay.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="photo_scenery.png" class="icon"> Topographic and bathymetric contours</span></dt>
  <dd>Contour data is computed from ETOPO5
  elevation data: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo5.HTML.  By
  default, only the 200&nbsp;m and 2000&nbsp;m bathymetric contours
  are shown, but the overlay can be modified to include any set of
  topographic or bathymetric contours.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="shapes.png" class="icon"> Shape files</span></dt>
  <dd>Line and polygon data stored in ESRI shapefile format or simple text
  files with lists of lat/lon values.
  Currently, shapefile support is limited: point data cannot be
  displayed, shape overlays cannot be saved to an overlay group, and
  shapefile rendering may be slow for large shapefiles.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="cubes_green.png" class="icon"> Single layer bitmask</span></dt>
  <dd>A single-color mask that uses a data variable and integer
  mask value to mask certain data pixels that contain the same
  bits as the mask value.  For example, a bitmask can be used to
  mask clouds as gray.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="cubes.png" class="icon"> Multilayer bitmask</span></dt>
  <dd>A multiple-color mask that uses a data variable and color
  for each bit to mask certain data pixels that contain the bit
  values with the corresponding color.  For example, a multilayer
  mask can be used to analyze the detailed output of a cloud
  masking algorithm.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="calculator.png" class="icon"> Expression Mask</span></dt>
  <dd>A single-color mask that uses a mathematical expression and
  color for each bit to mask certain data pixels for which the
  result of the expression is true.  An expression mask is slower
  to compute than a bitmask or multilayer, but is much more
  flexible.  See the User's Guide cwmath command for the syntax
  of the expressions.  Only variables imported when the data was
  opened can be used in the expression.</dd>

</dl>

<a name="list"></a>
<h2>Overlay list</h2>

<p>Once added to the list, overlays can be edited, renamed, set
visible or invisible, moved up or down in the list, and removed.
To edit an overlay's properties, double-click the overlay in the
list or select the overlay and click the 
<span class="button"><img src="document_edit.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Edit</span> button.  
You can change simple line properties
such as color and thickness directly from the list.  To rename an
overlay, edit the overlay's name text field.  Overlay visibility
can be changed by checking or unchecking the visibility box on
the left.  The overlay list represents a vertical stack and
overlays are rendered in order from bottom to top.  You can use
the 
<span class="button"><img src="arrow_up_green.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Move Up</span> and 
<span class="button"><img src="arrow_down_green.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Move Down</span> 
buttons to rearrange the overlay stacking order.
Finally, you can remove overlays by selecting a set of overlays
from the list using Ctrl-click (&#8984;-click on the Mac) or
Shift-click, and clicking 
<span class="button"><img src="garbage_empty.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Remove</span>.</p>

<a name="groups"></a>
<h2>Overlay groups</h2>

<p>Overlay groups are a convenient way of saving a set of
overlays to be used later.  Create a new overlay group using the
<span class="button"><img src="folder_add.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Create</span> button,
selecting the overlays to save to the group, and then entering a group name.
Click the 
<span class="button"><img src="folder_out.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Load</span> button
to load an overlay group or just double-click on the group name.
The overlays are restored with the same properties they had when saved, 
and stacked on top of any other overlays already in the list.  Delete an overlay group by
clicking 
<span class="button"><img src="folder_delete.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Delete</span>.</p>

<p>CDAT comes with a default set of overlay groups that you may find
useful; see the <a href="cdat_preferences.html#resources">preferences and
resources</a> section for more on where overlay groups are stored and other
things you can do with them.  If you make a mistake and delete or modify these default groups, you can click 
<span class="button"><img src="refresh.png" class="icon"></span> <span class="gui">Restore</span>
to recover them.</p>
