<h2>What are surveys?</h2>

<p>Surveys allow you to compute statistics on areas of the data
view.  Performing a data survey results in a printout of
statistics, a plot of the survey data, and an outline of the
survey area on the data view.  Surveys can be performed at a
point, along a line, or within a rectangle or polygon.</p>

<h2>Survey modes</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the current list of surveys, and the 
survey results and plot tabs:</p>

<p>You can perform a survey on the data using the CDAT toolbar buttons as 
follows:</p>

<dl>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="graph_node.png" class="icon"> Point</span></dt>
  <dd>A single point is surveyed, with no statistics or plot.  A point
  survey is a good way to mark a certain position and easily be able
  to recall its data value, such as for an ocean buoy.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="graph_edge.png" class="icon"> Line</span></dt>
  <dd>A straight line is surveyed, with statistics and a plot of the
  data values along the line.  A line survey simulates an airplane or
  ship track of the data values, and is useful for gradient and front
  analysis.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="shape_square.png" class="icon"> Rectangle</span></dt>
  <dd>A rectangular box is surveyed, with statistics and a plot of the
  histogram bins within the box.  A box survey is useful for a
  clustering analysis to show groups of similar data values in an area
  as peaks in the histogram.</dd>

  <dt><span class="button"><img src="shape_pentagon.png" class="icon"> Polygon</span></dt>
  <dd>A polygon is surveyed, with statistics and a plot of the
  histogram bins within the polygon.  Polygon surveys are similar to
  box surveys, but can help when the area has an irregular shape.</dd>

</dl>

<a name="list"></a>
<h2>Survey list</h2>

<p>Once added to the survey list, surveys are similar to
overlays, in that they can be modified, renamed, set visible or
invisible, moved up or down in the list, and removed &#8212; see the <a
href="cdat_overlays.html#list">overlays</a> section for details.
Select a survey in the list to recall its specific data in the
<span class="button">Results</span> and <span
class="button">Plot</span> tabs.</p>
