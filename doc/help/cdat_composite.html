<h2>What is a composite image?</h2>

<p>A composite image is a way of displaying the data from three
separate data variables in a single color image.  The red, green,
and blue components of each pixel color are derived from one of
the three data variables in the composite.  This method is
different from the standard color enhancement in which pixel
colors are derived from a single data variable and a color
palette.  The following figure shows an example of three separate
data variables being combined into one image:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cdat_composite_example.png"></p>

<p>These images are often referred to as <span class="emph">false
color</span> images.</p>

<h2>Color components</h2>

<p>The following figure shows the composite controls:</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="cdat_composite.png" width="260" class="shadow"></p>

<p>Any data variable from the list of imported variables may be
used in the composite.  Each variable is independently enhanced
using its range and function from the enhancement controls (see
the <a href="cdat_enhancement.html">enhancement</a> section for
details).  The enhancement palette is ignored in order to create
the composite.</p>

<h2>Composite mode</h2>

<p>Click the <span class="button">Toggle Color Composite Mode</span>
button to put CDAT into composite mode.  You can still use the other
control tabs while in composite mode to add data overlays,
annotation layers, etc.  Changes in the enhancement range and
function of any variable are reflected in the composite &mdash; you
may want to adjust the enhancement sliders to get the right mix
of red, green, and blue components.</p>
